# AOTY Add-ons

Hello. Here is a few different scripts I have made for AOTY (albumoftheyear) compiled into one big script with a settings menu for all of them.

Note: If you already have other of my scripts installed, remove it, it will bug out


# Features
## Unrounded Scores
AOTY scores as of now are rounded to have no decimals. This script removes that rounding and lets you put however many decimals you would like it to display.

### Unrounded Scores Settings:
- Toggle (On/Off) [Default: On]
- Decimals to show on main album pages (Int) [Default: 1]
- Font size to show on main album pages (Int) [Default: 39]
- Decimals to show on small album previews (Int) [Default: 2]
- Font size to show on small album previews (Int) [Default: 18]

## Hide Scores
This script was made with the idea that sometimes seeing album scores before listening to said album can influence your thoughts on it and set higher/lower expectations. This script attempts to fix that by hiding all scores, track ratings, and must hear badges when enabled.

### Hide Scores Settings:
- Toggle (On/Off) [Default: Off]
- Show score if already rated (On/Off) [Default: On]
- Hide critic reviews (On/Off) [Default: Off]
- Score replacement text (Str) [Default: N/A]

## Best Tracks Highlighter
If tracks are above a certain score with a certain amount of ratings they will be bolded.

### Best Tracks Highlighter Settings
- Toggle (On/Off) [Default: On]
- Minimum score to bold (Int) [Default: 90]
- Minimum number of ratings to bold (Int) [Default: 25]

## Rated Album Shuffle
Script to select a random album from your (or someone else's) ratings. This was made to find a random album to relisten to.

### Rated Album Shuffle Guide
- Go to a user's ratings page (Example: https://www.albumoftheyear.org/user/Rob/ratings/)
- Make sure you are on the first page of that user's ratings.
- Click backslash once, you will then be taken to a random page of the user's ratings.
- Click backslash one more time and you will be redirected to a random album from that page.

### Rated Album Shuffle Settings
- Toggle (On/Off) [Default: On]
- Keybind (Int) [Default: 220 (Backslash)]

For the keybind you must enter the key code for the key you would like. If you do not know how to find this go to https://keycode-visualizer.netlify.app.

## Average Artist Rating Viewer
Script that automatically calculates a user or critics average rating of an artist when viewed.

### Rated Album Shuffle Settings
- Toggle (On/Off) [Default: On]
